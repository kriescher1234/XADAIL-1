[DAIL] GitHub

So you want to contribute to DAIL?

Create an account at github.com

Locate the davoodinator/XADAIL repository.
	Fork this repository. It will mirror the files at YourName/XADIAL

Clone or Download the repository into Grim Dawn/mods

Copy the contents of Grim Dawn/mods/XADAIL into Grim Dawn/mods

You will have two complete file systems on your computer.
	mods/XADAIL
	Contents of mods/XADAIL
		mods/DAIL
		mods/DAIL - Rift
		mods/etc...
		
The files in Grim Dawn/mods are your working files. Make your alterations here and test play.

The files in Grim Dawn/mods/XADAIL will be your source should you need to revert any changes, 
	and this directory is used for creating Pull requests and merging updated changes from the master.
	https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-synch-a-github-fork-via-the-command-line/
	
Once your alterations are ready, run the XAGIT.bat file. It may require some editing to function correctly.
	This batch merges your changes from working to the mods/XADAIL material

From there, you will merge your changes with your Forked profile on github.com

Almost finaly step, create a Pull request with the master, davoodinator/XADAIL, to send your changes.

Final step, Davood does quality control and merges your changes.

This system does feel like it takes the long way around, but it is necessary to work with Grim Dawn.
	If you view the flow chart at https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-synch-a-github-fork-via-the-command-line/
		you will see how it all plays out. Our addition is to create the working material in Grim Dawn/mods so
		the asset manager can compile the material, and so the game can find the mod to run.
